# Development Plan

## Initial research and requirement gathering: Understand the specific requirements for the storage app and gather information on the technologies and tools that will be used to build the backend.

## Design: Create a detailed design for the backend, including the database schema, API structure, and overall architecture.

### Task 1: Database design
- [ ] Identify the data entities and relationships
- [ ] Choose a database technology (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Create the database schema

### Task 2: API design
- [ ] Identify the API endpoints and methods
- [ ] Design the API structure and routes
- [ ] Define the request and response formats

### Task 3: Authentication and Authorization design
- [ ] Identify the authentication and authorization requirements
- [ ] Choose an authentication method (e.g. JWT, OAuth)
- [ ] Design the authentication and authorization flow

### Task 4: File handling design
- [ ] Identify the file handling requirements
- [ ] Design the file storage and retrieval flow

### Task 5: Architecture design
- [ ] Identify the architectural requirements
- [ ] Choose an architectural pattern (e.g. MVC, Microservices)
- [ ] Design the overall architecture of the backend

## Development: Write the code for the backend using C++. Implement the database, API, and other features according to the design.

### Task 1: Database implementation
- [ ] Choose a database technology (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Create the database schema based on the design
- [ ] Implement functions for adding, updating, and retrieving data from the database

### Task 2: API implementation
- [ ] Design the API structure and endpoints
- [ ] Implement the API using a C++ web framework (e.g. CppCMS, Wt)
- [ ] Implement functions for handling API requests and interacting with the database

### Task 3: Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Choose an authentication method (e.g. JWT, OAuth)
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for the API
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive data is properly secured

### Task 4: File handling
- [ ] Implement functions for handling and storing files (e.g. images, documents)
- [ ] Implement functions for retrieving and displaying files

### Task 5: Error handling
- [ ] Implement error handling for the backend
- [ ] Ensure that appropriate error messages are returned to the client

### Task 6: Logging
- [ ] Implement logging for the backend
- [ ] Ensure that logs are properly stored and can be easily accessed for debugging and troubleshooting

## Testing: Test the backend thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected and fix any bugs that are found.

## Deployment: Deploy the backend to a production environment, such as a cloud-based server or a dedicated server.

## Maintenance: Monitor the backend for any issues and make updates or improvements as needed.

## Documenting: Document the backend for future reference and for other developers.
